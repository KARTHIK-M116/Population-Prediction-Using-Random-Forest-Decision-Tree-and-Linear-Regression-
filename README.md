# Population Prediction

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that implements a predictive model for population estimation using machine learning techniques. The notebook processes historical population data, applies suitable regression models, and evaluates their performance.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes:
- Historical population records
- Features such as year, population growth rate, and other relevant demographic data

## Features
- Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values and normalizes data.
- Model Selection: Implements regression models such as Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, or Neural Networks.
- Evaluation Metrics: Uses RMSE, MAE, and R-squared to assess model performance.

## Requirements
To run the notebook, install the following dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage
Clone the repository and open the notebook:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd PopulationPrediction
jupyter notebook PopulationPrediction.ipynb
```
Run all the cells in the notebook to see data visualization, model training, and predictions.

## Results
The notebook provides:
- Visual analysis of population trends
- Model predictions for future population estimates
- Performance comparison of different models
